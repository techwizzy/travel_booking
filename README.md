# Inspiration
So it was WRC weekend in Naivasha, Kenya and I thought many people had booked their stay with Airbnb. Inspired by Airbnbâ€™s intuitive design, I took on a weekend challenge to build a travel booking web app with Next.js. My focus was on creating an elegant, user-friendly experience that simplifies travel planning.
